Online Bookstore: Production-Ready E-commerce Solution

**[DEMO](https://novella-beta.vercel.app/)**

## Commercial Maturity & Focus

This project is a high-fidelity, full-stack e-commerce solution built to mimic the architecture and features required for a commercial-grade application. Our focus was on creating a stable backend, a scalable structure, and delivering advanced accessibility features that significantly enhance the product's market value and reach.

The application leverages a robust Next.js + Prisma stack, ensuring production readiness from the database layer to the UI.

## Architecture & Full-Stack Reliability

### 1. Robust Full-Stack Foundation

The project is built on a modern, cohesive technology stack, proving the team's ability to handle complex system integrations:

- Backend: Secured with Prisma and PostgreSQL, providing a reliable and type-safe data layer.
- Frontend: Built with Next.js and TypeScript, ensuring performance via server-side rendering and code stability.
- Data Handling: React Query manages all asynchronous server state (caching, synchronization), isolating data concerns for better maintainability.

### 2. Scalable Code Structure

- Atomic Design: The frontend components are structured according to Atomic Design principles, making the UI highly modular, reusable, and easy to scaleâ€”a critical factor in long-term commercial projects.
- Git Flow Workflow: The adherence to Git Flow ensures a mature CI/CD process, maintaining a perpetually stable main branch while allowing rapid, continuous feature development on stage.

## Production-Grade E-commerce Features

The core logic is implemented to handle complex user state and transactional processes:

- Secure Authentication: Implemented via NextAuth, supporting user persistence across devices.
- Persistent Shopping Cart & Favorites: Dedicated backend logic and API endpoints allow authenticated users to manage and securely store items in their Cart and Favorites database lists.
- Order Fulfillment: Complete order creation logic is implemented on the backend, ready for integration with payment and logistics services.
- Polished Forms: User input (including authentication) is handled using Formik and validated with the industry-standard Yup library.

## Inclusive & Advanced UX

A major differentiator of this project is its deep commitment to accessibility and a superior user experience, which expands the potential audience significantly.

### Accessibility (A11y) Innovations

- Color Blindness Themes: A unique, site-wide feature using SVG matrices provides three distinct color themes to assist users with common forms of color blindness.
- Visual Aid Zoom: The book detail page features a hover-zoom function on the cover image, serving as a direct accessibility feature for users with low vision.

### Performance & User Engagement

- Optimized Asynchronous Logic: The search bar includes debounce and skeleton loading, crucial for preventing unnecessary API calls and providing immediate, smooth visual feedback.
- Micro-interactions: Utilized Framer Motion for high-quality, non-disruptive animations and Toast Notifications to confirm every user action instantly (add to cart, add to favorites).
- Discovery Tools: Engaging features like the Random Book Modal and intelligent "You May Also Like" recommendations drive user engagement and encourage deeper site exploration.
